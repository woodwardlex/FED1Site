            <p id="about"> <!--style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; color: grey;"-->
                Woodward's Woodwork was founded in 1784 by Gil "Woody" Woodward during a time where furniture making was heading in a whole new direction. After the Civil War, there were few furniture businesses that were left due to ties to the British army. Using only the skills that had been passed down through generations of a family of woodworkers, Gil created Woodward's Woodwork from scratch in a new world.
